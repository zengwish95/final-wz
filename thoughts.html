      <h4> 思辨 Thoughts </h4>
        <h3> <a href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/" target="_blank">What Screens What </br> By Frank Chimero</a> <h3>
          <p> The analogy Chimero drew between plastics and the design of the web is quite compelling. It makes me wonder what other industries have experienced a similar aesthetic  paradigm shift? Seeing the design language for web and apps evolve from Skeuomorphism to flat colors, I realized how much of the graphic design industry follows the trends of the tech industry. Some five or six years ago almost every tech company has their logo with a unique taste and personality, yet now everyone is &ldquo;falling in line&rdquo; to flat colors, sans-serif typography and rounded corners. That has even spilled out from the tech scene into other industries as well (Fashion, Airlines, Restaurants) Chimero's arguments on creating a &ldquo;web map&rdquo; that true serves the public echoes with my own frustration on whether we as designers have any other choice than following the common trends. </p>
          <p> Also, Chimero's entire starting point into this inquiry with inspecting his Aspirin pills is a great reminder for designers and thinkers alike: Loosen up yourself a bit sometimes, be mindful of the objects around you and keep a keen eye on drawing parallels between things that are seemingly unrelated. </p>
        <h3> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">What is Code?</a> <h3>
          <p> Ford's 32,229-word essay on code is like an encyclopedia; interspersed with interactive code snippets for the reader to test out theories, and a virtual &ldquo;assistant&rdquo; on the bottom left evoking memories of the early Microsoft Word pushpin. This innovative web page design is a great example of building a platform that serves a distinctive goal — to draw interests to the often dry topics on coding, and offer a dynamic environment for readers. Aside from the technical knowledges Ford covered on coding in this essay, he also included plenty of industry insights. These deeper knowledge into the tech industry are intriguing for outsiders, and in some way adds a layer of human touch to the often overlooked life of coders and programmers. Considering this essay was first published in 2015, I wonder how much of the industry landscape Ford discussed have already drastically shifted? </p>
        <h3> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">Jodi's Infrastructure</a> <h3>
          <p> Galloway raises a probing question right at the beginning of his essay: Where does art as a practice really lie in the digital age? This is a critical question that we can not avoid discussing, as designers and artists, in the year of 2019. So often we are trapped inside an almost defaulted scheme of conceiving work, Jodi is telling us to leap out of that mindset. In all honesty, Jodi's collection of web and ASCII art serves little significance: they don't generate revenue or followers; yet it can be considered as a much needed break from web design trends. How can we all look into the backends of subject matters in design, breaking the norms and then assemble them in refreshing, thrilling ways? </p>
