      <h4> 思辨 Thoughts </h4>
        <h3 class="article"> <a href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/" target="_blank">What Screens What </br> By Frank Chimero</a> <h3>
          <p> The analogy Chimero drew between plastics and the design of the web is quite compelling. It makes me wonder what other industries have experienced a similar aesthetic  paradigm shift? Seeing the design language for web and apps evolve from Skeuomorphism to flat colors, I realized how much of the graphic design industry follows the trends of the tech industry. Some five or six years ago almost every tech company has their logo with a unique taste and personality, yet now everyone is &ldquo;falling in line&rdquo; to flat colors, sans-serif typography and rounded corners. That has even spilled out from the tech scene into other industries as well (Fashion, Airlines, Restaurants) Chimero's arguments on creating a &ldquo;web map&rdquo; that true serves the public echoes with my own frustration on whether we as designers have any other choice than following the common trends. </p>
          <p> Also, Chimero's entire starting point into this inquiry with inspecting his Aspirin pills is a great reminder for designers and thinkers alike: Loosen up yourself a bit sometimes, be mindful of the objects around you and keep a keen eye on drawing parallels between things that are seemingly unrelated. </p>
        <h3 class="article"> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">What is Code? </br> By Paul Ford</a> <h3>
          <p> Ford's 32,229-word essay on code is like an encyclopedia; interspersed with interactive code snippets for the reader to test out theories, and a virtual &ldquo;assistant&rdquo; on the bottom left evoking memories of the early Microsoft Word pushpin. This innovative web page design is a great example of building a platform that serves a distinctive goal — to draw interests to the often dry topics on coding, and offer a dynamic environment for readers. Aside from the technical knowledges Ford covered on coding in this essay, he also included plenty of industry insights. These deeper knowledge into the tech industry are intriguing for outsiders, and in some way adds a layer of human touch to the often overlooked life of coders and programmers. Considering this essay was first published in 2015, I wonder how much of the industry landscape Ford discussed have already drastically shifted? </p>
        <h3 class="article"> <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/" target="_blank">Jodi's Infrastructure </br> By Alexander R. Galloway</a> <h3>
          <p> Galloway raises a probing question right at the beginning of his essay: Where does art as a practice really lie in the digital age? This is a critical question that we can not avoid discussing, as designers and artists, in the year of 2019. So often we are trapped inside an almost defaulted scheme of conceiving work, Jodi is telling us to leap out of that mindset. In all honesty, Jodi's collection of web and ASCII art serves little significance: they don't generate revenue or followers; yet it can be considered as a much needed break from web design trends. How can we all look into the backends of subject matters in design, breaking the norms and then assemble them in refreshing, thrilling ways? </p>
        <h3 class="article"> <a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/" target="_blank">A Vernacular Web </br> By Olia Lialina</a> <h3>
          <p> Lialina's time-capsule-like documentation of web design trends back in 2005 hits home again an important observation: web design trends also come in cycles, styles come and go like fashion trends. The design language Lialina described are no doubt outdated from today's viewpoints, but it's worth noting they were once &ldquo;state-of-the-art&rdquo; tools and graphic elements one would use to showcase their skills. As trends shift, semantic values associated with these trends are bound to be affected as well. One great example Lialina brought up is the &ldquo;Under Construction&rdquo; sign early web developers favored. No one would've predicted that such a sign first used as a symbol to show efforts eventually turned into a mere joke. Learning the vernaculars and their associated meanings, in different practical and cultural contexts should become an essential part of design process. Without true understanding and appreciation for the tools we use, one will not be able to generate work that truly speaks to its intended audiences. </p>
        <h3 class="article"> <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/04/google-facebook-informational-capitalism/" target="_blank"> Capitalism vs. Privacy </br> By Saumel Earle</a> <h3>
          <p> Earle's essay is another telling-tale on the issue of privacy. His viewpoints are quite common and foundamental, at least to readers like me who pay attention on privacy and surveillance issues related to the web. The strongest agreement I share with Earle is the fact that Authorities no longer control the mass with a distinctively dystopian outlook: there are no soldiers staring into your screens or task forces actively arresting dissidents. Governments around the world, especially authoritarian regimes, have adopted a series new forms of programs and tools to track information and collect data. For most people, their daily routines online subtly contribute to these processes. For a typical WeChat user in China, their shopping behaviors, comments and movements throughout the city are all critical information authorities and corporates seek to lay hands on. The danger to new forms of surveillance is not the seemingly &ldquo;harmful&rdquo; data they harvest, but the clueless users who integrate these services as essential segments of their private lives. We are already very close to a point where the majority of internet users who indulge themselves in these online entertainment platforms like social media and streaming services are oblivious of the fact that they have become the product instead of the user. </p>
        <h3 class="article"> <a href="http://internet-atlas.net/" target="_blank"> Critical Atlas of the Internet </br> By Louise Drulhe</a> <h3>
          <p> Druhle's Atlas of the Internet takes on an alternative perspective into the web that we interact with everyday. She did an excellent job at attempting to decipher and map out the forms and structures within this abstract entity that we call the internet. Through the act of constructing models and diagrams that analyzes web structures and our relationships with the web, Druhle poetically illustrates our love and hate tug-of-war with the internet services we rely on. Major online services like Google and Facebook left a residue of frustrations in our lives, they suck us into their own spheres of influence, discouraging discoveries of the web outside of their territories. The internet has turned from a spontaneous ground for unexpected encounters, to a preset of formalities that keeps chipping away our personal time. </p>
