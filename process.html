      <h4> 途中 Process </h4>
      <p> How each project came to fruition, and some of my personal notes along the way. </p>
      <h3 class="article"> 1. Styling Lyrics: </br> City Blocks and Roads On a Web Page</a> <h3>
      <p> Starting with the styling lyrics project for Andrew Bird's ode to Chicago &ldquo;Pulaski at Night&rdquo; I immediately thought of using the famous grid blocks in Chicago as a foundation structure for my web page. However I removed most hints to the city grid in the end product, leaving only each line of the song as a super long block, spanning from top to bottom of the page. The scrolling motion echoes the act of someone having to travel all the way across the city, to reach somewhere, or someone. </p>
      <img src="images/p7.png" alt="Layout inspiration for lyrics project.">
      <p> Fun Fact: Chicago's Pulaski Road spans north from Wilmette Avenue south to Lincoln Highway. Its total length is a staggering 39.3 miles. </p>
      <h3 class="article"> 2. Josef Müller-Brockmann Poster: </br> Bringing the Grid onto the Web </h3>
      <p> It was an enjoyable process to learn how to bring grids as a designing tool into the web production process. I have always loved tweaking details in my work and brining forms of order and structure. CSS grids is an amazing help for me, as it makes the workflow of building a page from scratch extremely visual. </p>
      <img src="images/p1.jpg" alt="Sketch of the grid structure.">
      <p> I find that for assigning elements into a CSS grid, setting up a grid structure table is extremely helpful when it comes to time to assign elements into each grid cell. </p>

      <p> Finished poster with the grid seen from Chrome's inspector. Satisfying! </p>
      <h3 class="article"> 3. De-Design the Web: </br> Keeping Up With the Followers Game </h3>
      <p> This quick interactive sketch was a double play on the word &ldquo;Follow&rdquo;. We are being followed everyday: Both physically with our locations being shared to online services; and metaphorically with our internet profiles being seen by the mass. Maintaining a &ldquo;Follower base&rdquo; actually has become a goal many people pursue rather than something to be feared of. Taking hints from the UI language of Instagram, I designed this page to be a reminder of how ridiculous our obsession with followers is. Hopwfully making the numbers of followers out of context and intangible offers the viewer a chance to reflect. This also serves as a timer counting down &mdash; what would happen when your follower number reaches zero eventually? Is that a good thing or a bad thing? </p>
      <h3 class="article"> 4. Data Record: </br> Paths of Border Crossings </h3>
      <p> Traveling across international borders is an activity I frequently take on, especially since I moved from China to the US in 2013. For most people, these trips are often just a mundane routine they have to endure. But for me, my love for travelling and aviation helped me maintained a detailed record of my trips. Using these data points, what patterns of travel can be revealed? Most of these border crossings actually now take place in an airport, where there is no physical border line to cross. What does the &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of borders tell us about our geopolitical status-quo? I find myself extremly lucky and privileged to be able to make most of my crossings inside an airport, compared to someone scrambling for their life trying to make it into a &ldquo;promised land&rdquo;. </p>
